Well, a pandemic certainly wasn't part of the plan. Here we are, almost eight months since my first post, with few changes since I last checked in. Zero changes, in fact, until yesterday.

The good news is that a big reason for the scant progress is I started a full-time job as an associate software engineer at [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/), a financial-analysis company, just a week after the Gatsby version of this site went live. I had to give myself a crash course in Jest testing, plus the Vue framework, plus deployment and site management in AWS, jumping from project to project at the same time. It's been fun and challenging, but it hasn't left me much time to come back to this.

And then COVID-19 came around and just completely flipped things over. I've been working from home since early March, moving between Zoom meetings, pair coding with colleagues when they have time, and otherwise solving problems on my own. I was spending so much time in front of my computer in the early months that I started to develop carpal tunnel. I've since backed off and improved the ergonomics of my home office, but I'm still nursing my hands back to full health.

Moving forward, as I start to find a regular cadence again, I hope to share some of the things I've been learning in my new job, particularly regarding AWS, which is a world unto itself.

I'll try not to let another eight months sneak by.
